# Debug interfaces for Arduino (TM32U585)

As usual for the old Arduino Uno, we can use Serial.print() to show information. As ths works well in the mode, an USB cable is plugged to the USB C slot (Arduino Lab is providing a serial monitor) this doesn't work in the pure wireless mode, when there is no USB connection the PC.

Two ways of Debugging are shown here:
