# Arduino-Uno-Q-Projects

## Project Ideas
In the chapters below, the integration of GenAI models like **qwen3:0.6b** or video streaming by an USB Webcam is shown. 

### Prerequisites
The Arduino has Qualcomm’s advanced **QRB2210** Microprocessor (MPU) running a full Debian Linux OS with upstream support, and the real-time responsiveness of a **STM32U585** microcontroller (MCU) running Arduino sketches over Zephyr OS. Together with the extension of a Large Language Model we could collect some interesting project ideas. 
Due to the lack of a powerful hardware and the fact, the llm is running locally from a USB-C connected sdcard, the medium response time of the LLM is about 90 seconds. We should take this into account for our ideas.

### Idea Collection
These ideas are engineered so the LLM only runs occasionally, while **the STM32 MCU** handles all real-time tasks:
##### ✔ LLM only makes _high-level_, infrequent decisions
##### ✔ MCU handles all real-time or fast interactions
##### ✔ Use queues, passing message, and buffers
##### ✔ Treat the LLM as a “slow global brain”
##### ✔ Great for planning, summarizing, or generating code/text
##### ✔ Avoid chatty or interactive applications
