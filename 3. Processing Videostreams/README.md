## Background
The idea behind is to capture the face landmarks via YOLO8 [# ultralytics](https://pypi.org/project/ultralytics/) and provide the landmarks to qwen3 for interpretation. While YOLOv8 is primarily known for object recognition, Ultralytics has also released specialized models that can be used for tasks such as pose estimation and segmentation. For your specific requirement—extracting viewpoints—the YOLOv8 Pose Estimation model is ideal because it provides keypoints.

## First Steps
We are using the .venv already created in chapter 2.

    pip install ultralytics
    pip install opencv-python

The sample code for face detection is:
