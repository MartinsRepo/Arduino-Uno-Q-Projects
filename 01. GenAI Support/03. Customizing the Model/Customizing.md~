## Customizing Ollama Models in Podman

This guide explains how to create a custom model (persona) using a `Modelfile` and integrate it into a Python-based workflow.

### 1. Prerequisites (as done before)

-   **Podman** installed and running.
    
-   **Ollama** container running (e.g., named `ollama`).
    
-   Base model pulled (e.g., `qwen3:0.6B`).
    

### 2. Create a Modelfile

The `Modelfile` acts as a blueprint for your custom model. It defines the base model, system instructions, and generation parameters.

**File:** `Modelfile`


    # Specify the base model
    FROM qwen3:0.6B
    # Set the system prompt (Persona)
    SYSTEM """You are a specialized DevOps assistant. 
    Always provide concise answers and explain technical terms 
    briefly using bullet points."""
    # Adjust model parameters
    PARAMETER temperature 0.7
